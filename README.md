# Smart Recipe Generator – Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the Smart Recipe Generator web app.

The app lets you:

- Upload a photo of your fridge/pantry
- Detect and confirm ingredients from the image
- Get recipe suggestions based on those ingredients
- “Like” recipes you want to keep
- Enter your health goals (lose / maintain / gain) and view a final list of your favourite recipes
